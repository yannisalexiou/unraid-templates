    iOS Tech Lead passionate about developer tooling and automation. 
    I create lightweight, production-ready Docker containers focused on developer workflows — like real-time App Store Connect webhook proxies for Slack and Microsoft Teams.
    
    All my containers follow a clear purpose: minimal, secure, and easy to integrate into CI/CD or self-hosted environments.
